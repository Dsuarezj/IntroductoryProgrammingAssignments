Introductory Programming Assignments
======


## Synopsis

Here are some basic console programming exercises for ThoughtWorks University program. 

## Motivation

I perform these exercises as part of my learning process of JAVA and OOP. This is helping me to be better prepare, as a Developer, for TWU.


## Versions

These exercises were performed using **Java JDK 1.7.0_80** in **IntelliJ IDEA 2016.1.3**.


## About the exercises

In total, there are 9 exercises where basic programming functions of Java is reviewed.

###Triangle Exercises

**1. Easiest exercise ever:**
Print one asterisk to the console.

Example: 

``` 
* 
```

Code: `src/EasiestExerciseEver.java`

**2. Draw a horizontal line:**
Given a number n, print n asterisks on one line.

Example: 
when n=8:  

``` 
******** 
```

Code: `src/DrawAHorizontalLine.java`


**3. Draw a vertical line:**
Given a number n, print n lines, each with one asterisks


Example: 
when n=3:

```
*
*
*
```

Code: `src/DrawAVerticalLine.java`

**4. Draw a right triangle:**
Given a number n, print n lines, each with one more asterisk than the last (i.e. one on the first line, two on the second,etc.) 

Example:
when n=3:

```
*
**
***
```

Code: `src/DrawARightTriangle.java`

###Diamond Exercises

**5. Isosceles Triangle:**
Given a number n, print a centered triangle. 

Example: 
for n=3:

```
  *
 ***
*****
```
Code: `src/DrawAIsoscelesTriangle.java`

**6. Diamond:**
Given a number n, print a centered diamond. 

Example: 
for n=3:

```
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

Code: `src/Diamond.java`

**7. Diamond with Name:**
Given a number n, print a centered diamond with your name in place of the middle line. 

Example:
for n=3:

```
  *
 ***
Bill
 ***
  *
```

Code: `src/DiamondWithName.java`

###FizzBuzz Exercise

FizzBuzz is a simple number game where you count, but say "Fizz" and/or "Buzz" instead of numbers adhering to certain rules.

Create a FizzBuzz() method that prints out the numbers 1 through 100.
Instead of numbers divisible by three print "Fizz".
Instead of numbers divisible by five print "Buzz".
Instead of numbers divisible by three and five print "FizzBuzz".


Example:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

Code: `src/FizzBuzzExercise.java`

###Prime Factors Exercise

Write a method generate(int n) that given an integer N will return a list of integers such that the numbers are the factors of N and are arranged in increasing numerical order.

For example: 

```
Generate(1) should return an empty list.

Generate(30) should return the numbers: 2,3,5.
```

Code: `src/PrimeFactorsExercise.java`
